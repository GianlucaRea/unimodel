# Unimodel
University Project for the course of Model Driven Engineering at the University of L'Aquila for the Master's Degree in Advanced Software Engineering.

## Description
The project is a collection of homework where we used model-driven tools and techniques to model a University.
In the first homework, we defined a concept and an editor for each of the metaclasses presented previously.
In the second homework, we defined our metamodel and added constraints, operations and derivated fields to it. We also represented two models of Universities.
In the third homework, we performed two model transformation techniques. The transformations were the model-to-model transformation and model to text.
We divided the fourth homework into two parts. In the first half, we have created a XTextlanguage for our metamodel
defined in the second homework. In the second part, we have made a straightforward graphical editor
to visualize and edit the domain.
